# OD_Relative_Agreement
We study opinion formation in virtual social groups - conservative and liberal - with heterogeneous agents. The agents are either stubborn or flexible, 
and the strength of their interactions depends on the relative agreement of opinions.Every agent is also endowed with varying levels of individual 
popularity, opinion bias and sociability. We evaluate the impact of group composition and network connectivity on the outcome. The code is written in 
Julia. Additional modeling details and simulation results are in the pdf. For further details, check https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9597470/
